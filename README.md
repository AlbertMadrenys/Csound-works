# Csound Works
This portfolio encompasses notable work that I have done in `Csound`.

## Vocoder Arpeggiator
`Vocoder Arpeggiator` is a `Cabbage` plugin written in `Csound`. It is a classic channel vocoder, but with the possibility to arpeggiate notes from a base fundamental.

## Vocoder Waveshaper
This `CSoundQT` application is a vocoder, but instead of a static sawtooth excitation signal, we can use the result of a waveshaper function.
